new option in PlotDynamics, PlotInterpolatingFunction: Histogram, PlotType
Simplify->True now in Inv, new option: SimplifyOpts, got rid of RealSimplify
added MakeInterpolatingFunctionPeriodic, now used in FindEcoCycle & FindEcoEvoCycle
GetPlotRange
removed Compile->False from EcoSim's RecurrenceTable
Inv: DiscreteTime Floquet mode -- add initial time
GrayScale
changed Epilog to Prolog in PlotInv to put TAD in back

InequalityToInterval
parameters: RuleListSet, ClearParameters, ParameterValues
new traits declaration method using Traits

fixed OutputTMin in DiscreteTime EcoSim

Lists are not considered TemporalDataQ anymore

major consolidation:
PlotTAD will revert to old name, PlotGuild
if there are traits, put traits on axis; if there are no traits, put species number (for interaction-based models)
if sol is a list of numbers, do like the old PlotTAD; if sol is a temporal list, then ArrayPlot or Plot3D
